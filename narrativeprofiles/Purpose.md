Narrative profiles play an important role in implementing of the xAPI standard.  This will vary by implementer, but the primary purposes for current profiles are:

1) provide a human readable version for developers to implement xAPI
2) provide a human readable version for referencing in content development contracts
3) provide intent of the Community of Practice that implemented the profile
4) articulate requirements that at this time cannot be done within the normal xAPI Profile specification
